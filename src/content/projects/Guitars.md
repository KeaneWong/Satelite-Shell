So, I can't play guitar at all or any musical instrument.
This isn't just me being modest either, some musicians say 
they can't play out of humility but genuinely I have never
learned a song and cannot name any major or minor chord. 

It might be a little strange then that I'm currently putting
together my 6th custom guitar. 

Do I run a luthier business? Nope. Do I take commissions 
from acquaintances as a side hustle? Also no, but I should
be. 
Do I have some kind of deep-seated guitar making compulsion
left over from a tragic origin story that's put me on trajectory
to become Luthierman, latest of Batman's villains of the week?

That last one might actually be true, but no. 

Honestly, I have no idea why I'm doing this.

Anyway, here's a couple of the guitfiddles I
make whenever I have 400$ to throw away on lumber and parts.


#### The Raybenez

![Raybenez](Raybenez.png "The Raybenez")
I call this copyright infringing beauty of a thumbnail 
the **Raybenez**, combination Music Man Stingray innards
with an Ibanez headless bass style body, hence the extreme
horn and deep curves. It's built neck-through, with the
body middle, neck, and headstock all being one piece.

Fretboard is Purple Heartwood (not that I can tell, colorblind),
the body and neck are Tigerwood (not the guy), and the wiring
was put together from a passive pickup diagram which, I have 
to warn you, is not suited for a Stingray at all. 

It works, and due to the density of the wood it has some insane
sustain, but if you're looking for something more heavy metal, 
I would point you to...

#### Marceline's Guitar
![Barceline](Barceline.png "Marceline's Guitar IRL")
This is the point where I'm probably carbon dating myself
to most of you, but if you have no idea what this is, it's 
a faithful recreation of Marceline's guitar from Adventure
Time which I grew up watching in the 2000s.

When I say 'faithful' recreation, I really strive for 
accuracy.

In that spirit, the body is a quarter-inch solid-steel
plate, and the neck is steel rectangular tubing with an oak
fretboard cold welded onto it. The body is beveled to 
provide a blunt edge, not enough to slice your jeans if 
you play it sitting down but heavy and sharp enough to
make you hate playing it with all your being.
<br/>But, to its credit, the string action is insanely low.

Pretty close right?

And yes, it can play music. I have securely and professionally 
taped down the delicate electronics as shown above, 
configuring the pickups for J-Bass output for a surprising
amount of punchiness.
And yes, it does smash. I've slain many cardboard boxes
with the thing, and no worse for wear (at least no more
than there was already.)

#### Hades Guitar
![Hades Guitar](HadesGuitar.png "Hades Guitar")

This one is modeled after [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/)
if you're familiar, and specifically takes influence from
the [Sigil of the Dead]("https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Keepsakes?file=Sigil_of_the_Dead.png).

My twin brother loves Hades; he's actually something of a
pro. He's to this day the only one I know to beat 32 heat
with just no weapons, just dash. 

Anyway, this was a Christmas gift to him, and one of my
favorite builds to date.

#### Pokemon Twins

![Pokemon Twins](PokemonTwins.png "Pokemon Twins")

You ever look at an animal and think "wow that's really
a really object-shaped living creature, lets make it
into a thing we can use" and that's basically how I 
came up with these guys.

Carbon dating myself again, but my brothers and I grew
up with Pok√©mon and unlike me, my older brother picked
up actual guitar playing. So, for Christmas I found out 
his favorite pokemon in the world: 

Blaziken.

Well sucked to be him cause he's getting a Sharpedo 
guitar instead.

As it turns out, the dorsal and pectoral fins are 
almost the perfect shape to fit the equivalent of
outward curves on a normal guitar making the thing
passably playable for the purposes of playing the thing
on your lap, which he did a lot of on account of
his leg being broken for that Christmas.

The right is a personal favorite of mine and is based off
this generation 7 monstrosity:

![Alt Alolan Exeggutor](Exeggutor.png)

I call him
'Melvin', named after his older brother 'Marvin', his
prototype who snapped horribly due to a lack of a 
truss rod. Rest peacefully Marvin, but long live the
king.

I built them because I wanted a bass guitar in college,
didn't want to spend so much money on having one, and 
saw that this green thing has a long neck and so does 
the instrument I wanted. All in all, a fun project but
I would not suggest hand carving a neck as a novice, at
least without some guidance and a mentor. 

### Conclusions
I can't believe anybody read this far. If you're reading
this, I appreciate you going through my unfiltered
ramblings on this nonsensical hobby of mine.<br/>
If you've scrolled to the end to see if there's a point
to this article, I'm here to tell you confidently, not
really but if you have a cool guitar idea, send it to me.

Next on my Todo list:
- Guitar that activates embedded stun gun in headstock
- Violin made of animal bones

Will update soon.
