The surge of Abrasion in Stormlight always looked kinda 
lame to me (bear with me) up until I started working on 
this game. It's not the Surge's fault; it just seems that 
some of the powers look vastly outclassed by some of the
other Surges.

The books even kinda touch on this in TWoK, where in the
Chasms, we're being told the Radiants can fly, run on
walls, heal sickness, etc. and Kaladin just says "Wait,
if the Radiants could fly why would they be sticking to 
walls or running fast?" Why apply magic oil slick and
skate at wild speeds when you can literally pick yourself
off the ground and fly far, far away?

I think this is vastly influenced by the fact that
Abrasion is not very well explored and Gravitation has 
been at the forefront of the series since the beginning
because of Kaladin so its not a fair comparison since we
just haven't seen the Abrasion-using Radiant orders in 
the spotlight yet.

Unfortunately, my video game cannot wait 4 years 
for Lift's viewpoint book to release to see Abrasion 
expanded on. So I once again allow myself to possibly
blasphemy the source material by introducing my own 
interpretations of the powers, and take some liberties with
it. 

Unlike Progression which has been lovingly mangled into
an RPG-esque buff system, Abrasion I think is much closer
to what the Sanderson intended. Gravitation is going to be 
clear to me; flight, wall running, throwing objects, etc.

So, to make Abrasion distinct, it needs some things that
are **strict** advantages, such as:

1. Faster movement through elimination of air resistance
2. Snappier movement from increases of friction
3. Better dodging, as you 'slick' away from enemy attacks

And yeah, take that Gravitation, you starving overrated 
main character power set. You may have cinematic appeal
and a more useful utility in Roshar, but in my game you
get something way better: Frame data.

But, the problem is that it's a bit of a boring power set.
Most of this is very easy to implement in game as numerical
tweaks; Increase movement speed, reduce lag on direction
changes, increase invincibility frames on the dodge and 
parry mechanic, etc. It would still be interactive, but 
it's not visually exciting.

Luckily, we can make it a bit cooler to look at.

At the beginning of the project, I put together an after
image script based off [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/scjxbu/after_image_effect_for_animated_sprites/).
I slightly tweaked it to make it work recursively with all
sprite renderers in the game object's children and disables
all associated scripts other than the sprite renderers before
instantiating the images (and increasing transparency).

So, in addition to the tweaks I made above, I added 
after images to the dash, adjusted the running
animations, and added a custom 'friction' protocol that 
reduces speed more gradually when stopping.

Here's a comparison normal movement:

<video controls={false} loop width="75%" muted autoplay alt="Regular Movement">
<source src={AbrasionDemo0} type="video/mp4"  ></source>
</video>

And here's a comparison with the Abrasion movement:

<video controls={false} loop width="75%" muted autoplay alt="Abrasion Movement">
<source src={AbrasionDemo1} type="video/mp4"  ></source>
</video>

So it's not actually that much faster, but it definitely
_feels_ faster and for a proof of concept I'm happy with 
how it looks for now. 
<br/>The next step now is to add some other functions;
Abrasion might be able to
1. Let you wall climb
2. Increase air resistance and prevent fall damage
3. Trip enemies

Whether any of this is relevant, we'll see on how the
game turns out. 

Until next time, I'll leave it like this.

Some TODOs for next time:
1. Add wall running
2. Adjust air speed and acceleration
