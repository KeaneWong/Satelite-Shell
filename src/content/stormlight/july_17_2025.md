Update since a couple weeks ago: I have now, officially,
finished up the Cryptic!
Or at least the aesthetic for them. 

![Alt ZZ Celia](2025/ZZ_Celia.png)

Meet the non-binary Cryptic I'm calling 
`Z.Z Celia`, non-binary because while 
designing them I had a fairly hard
time ascribing a concrete sense of human 
identity to this jumble of math.

What do the `Z`s mean?
<br/>Each one also means `Z.Z Celia`, making
the name a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym). 

![Alt Mandelbrot equation](2025/MandelbrotEquation.png)

And the name is based off the [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
fractal, which was used in their shader equation.
<br/> The `Z`'s together represent the first part
of the equation, and `Celia` is just a name that
shares the same letter as the constant `C` in the 
equation.

So, the mathematically gifted of you might have
noticed: Hey, the spren in the screenshot
above isn't the Mandelbrot set fractal, it's a 
[Julia set Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)!
<br/>Kudos if you spotted that off my blurry
screenshot somehow. Z.Z Celia is rendered using
the Julia set fractal, not the Mandelbrot because
the Julia set fractal can be animated in a way
that doesn't increase computation cost as it
runs, unlike a Mandelbrot zoom that gets more
complex with higher zooms (Also, Julia sets tend
to look more tendril-ly)

And I say rendered because the spren in-game is
not a gif, it's a custom fractal shader that 
generates the Julia set procedurally.

Is it efficient? <br/>Hell no, the performance is
magnitudes worse than displaying a gif.

Is it better looking? <br/>Probably not, using
animation frames would let us use higher 
definition images for cheaper.

But is it accurate to the books to do it like this? 
<br/> Yup and that's the one single benefit. 
This animation might be single-handedly
tanking the performance of the game by itself, 
but Z.Z Celia is an entity of pure math, just
like a real Cryptic. 


What else, what else...

![Alt Illumination Dummy](2025/IlluminationDummy.png)

Illumination prototype is coming along well.
Currently, the Lightweaving dummy (left) is rendered live
based on what pose the player is in when the player
creates the dummy, just like a real Lightweaving.

The real player (right) then becomes invisible,
currently represented by the slight transparency.

The dummy has its own hurtbox and health bar, but
since I have not figured out how I'll do the enemies
yet, I can't use the dummy to 'draw aggro' like
I intend it to. Similarly, the invisibility isn't
helping our Surgebinder hide from anything, since
there's nothing to hide from.

##### Anyway, for some TODOs:
- When the enemies are implemented, make them target the dummy and not the player. Maybe, even turn the player to a different layer.
- Add stormlight wisp particle effects when creating the Lightweaving (pending the general necessity to add real art to all my stuff).
- Do some more writing for ZZ.

Until next time, keep creating.
