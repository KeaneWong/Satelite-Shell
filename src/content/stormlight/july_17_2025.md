Update since a couple weeks ago: I have now, officially,
finished up the Cryptic!
Or at least the aesthetic for them. 

![Alt QQ Cos](2025/QQ_Cos.png)

Meet the non-binary Cryptic I'm calling 
`Z.Z Caya`, non-binary because while 
designing them I had a fairly hard
time ascribing a concrete sense of human 
identity to this jumble of math.

What do the `Z`s mean?
<br/>Each one also means `Z.Z Caya`, making
the name a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym). 

![Alt Mandelbrot equation](2025/MandelbrotEquation.png)

And the name is based off the [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
fractal, which was used in their shader equation.
<br/> The `Z`'s together represent the first part
of the equation, and `Caya` is just a name that
shares the same letter as the constant `C` in the 
equation.

So, the mathematically gifted of you might have
noticed: Hey, the spren in the screenshot
above isn't the Mandelbrot set fractal, it's a 
[Julia set Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)!
<br/>Kudoos if you spotted that off my blurry
screenshot somehow. Q.Q Caya is rendered using
the Julia set fractal, not the Mandelbrot because
the Julia set fractal can be animated in a way
that doesn't increase computation cost as it
runs. 

And I say rendered because the spren in-game is
not a gif, it's a custom fractal shader that 
generates the Julia set procedurally.

Is it a good idea? <br/>Hell no, the performance is
magnitudes worse than displaying a gif.

Is it better looking? <br/>Probably not, using
animation frames would let us use higher 
definition images for cheaper.

But is it accurate to the books to do it like this? 
<br/> Yup and that's the one single benefit. 
They might be single-handedly
tanking the performance of the game by itself, 
but Q.Q Caya is an entity of pure math, just
like a real Cryptic.
